# Simple website

## Instructions

Your goal is to explore various tags and elements commonly used in HTML, as well as common CSS properties and
attributes.

### Option 1

Create a single-page website that displays your work/experiences in a single area that you enjoy.
For example, your work in photography, programming, music, etc.

### Option 2

Create a simple site that collates and displays your favorite experiences (e.g., music, photos, books).

Regardless of which option you choose, [this](https://chjus.github.io/ChJus/) can serve as a basic reference for what
your site may look like (try to have more variety in elements used!).

Suggested tasks:

- Implement hover effects (e.g., box-shadow, opacity, or color changes).
- Consider designing a navigation bar.
- Consider light/dark mode and responsive design (e.g., consideration for mobile device viewport).
- Explore CSS gradients, and the addition of decorative elements, typefaces/fonts, and icons.
- Explore how to embed videos and audio clips or external files in your site.
