In this task, you will implement the above design
(from [FrontendMentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/age-calculator-app-dF9DFFpj-Q)).

The app should be able to accurately calculate the age of a person from a given input birth date.
You may want to consider error handling — for negative years or invalid months and dates.

- Light/dark mode
- Responsive design — consideration for mobile viewports.
- Typography and color palette
- **Challenge**: add a simple animation when the age updates (e.g., implement a number counter/ticker animation).

Styling:
